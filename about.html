    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    <p>Adah's Health And Beauty was conceived after many years of research and trial and error in order to find solutions to major skin care  concerns.
        Our founder Ms. Doreen had struggled for many years with acne and oily skin and found it difficult to get the best products suitable for her. It is after this that she finally decided to create a website that would address skin care concerns and help other people.
        <p>We offer tips on how to take care of your skin and also make sure we are a part of your skincare journey. Our goal is to ensure you feel beautiful in your own skin and you achieve your skincare goals!</p>
